According to the prevailing interpretation of Aristotle’s Prior Analytics, a complete (teleios) sullogismos (plural: sullogismoi) is an argument such that the conclusion’s following from the premises is obvious. An incomplete (atelês) sullogismos is an argument such that the conclusion follows from the premises but the conclusion’s following from the premises is not obvious. A completed (teleioumenos) sullogismos is a chain of reasoning that demonstrates for an argument that the conclusion follows from the premises—typically, the argument in question is an incomplete sullogismos. [I say typically because there is no reason why one may not supply a chain of reasoning for an argument such that the conclusion’s following from the premises is obvious.] On this interpretation, a completed sullogismos is what is today known as a deduction. When Aristotle speaks of sullogismoi in general—not specifically about incomplete or complete sullogismoi—he is talking about chains of reasoning, not mere arguments. For example, where Aristotle says that apodeixis is a special case of sullogismos, a sullogismos must be a chain of reasoning, for a demonstration (apodeixis) is certainly more than a pairing of premises with a conclusion. We will take the above observations, which are the foundations of the Corcoran-Smiley interpretation, as the starting point for this paper. We will not be directly engaging with interpretations that are incompatible with them—for example, the interpretation of Lukasiewicz, for whom a sullogismos is a conditional proposition. Given that sullogismos in the general sense means deduction our concern is to ask how we should understand what Aristotle means when he says of a given sullogismos that it is “from hypothesis” (ex hupotheseôs).
The question arises because many scholars who agree that sullogismoi are deductions nonethless claim that sullogismoi “from hypothesis” are not deductions. On their reading, which traces its origins back to Alexander of Aphrodisias, the phrase sullogismos ex hupotheseôs may be compared to the phrase “toy train” [example comes from Crivelli]. Our calling something a toy train communicates not that it is a train but just the opposite, that it is not really a train. Likewise, on their interpretation, Aristotle’s calling something a sullogismos “from hypothesis” communicates not that it is a sullogismos but just the opposite, that it is not really a sullogismos. The main problem with this interpretation is that Aristotle calls indirect deductions sullogismoi “from hypothesis”, and indirect deductions really are deductions (sullogismoi). Given that fact, it is more likely that sullogismos “from hypothesis” really is a species of deduction (sullogismos), and we need to consider what kind of deduction it is.
